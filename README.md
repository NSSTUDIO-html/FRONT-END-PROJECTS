# FRONT-END-PROJECTS

A curated collection of standalone **HTML-based front-end demos and mini-projects**â€”a playground of experiments, layouts, and UI components.

##  Project Highlights

This repository includes a diverse array of `.html` files covering concepts such as:

- Interactive components (e.g., forms, image sliders, gauges)
- CSS/JavaScript experiments (e.g., animations, charting, Web APIs)
- Project templates and UI snippets (e.g., login screens, skill trackers, responsive layouts)
- Specialized demos with technologies like Tailwind CSS, Canvas, AJAX, TensorFlow.js, and WebAR

Purpose
A sandbox to practice front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and JS.

Ideal for visual learners and portfolio builders.

Easy to extend: just add your own .html files for new experiments.
